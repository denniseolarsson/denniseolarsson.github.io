I'm a cognitive neuroscience researcher and data scientist. I obtained my PhD at the University of Sussex in the Unitd Kingdom in 2022, finished a two year postdoctodal research contract at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden in 2024, and am currently in the Netherlands looking for a job. 

I enjoy coding, and have extensive experience with quantitative data analysis and programming in multiple languages, with a moajor focus on Python, MATLAB, and RStudio. 

My research interest are interoception with a focus on the cardiovascular system, and brain-body interaction.
