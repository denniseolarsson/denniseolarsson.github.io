I am a cognitive neuroscience researcher, and incoming Humboldt postdoctoral fellow at Kiel University. I obtained my PhD at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom in 2022, and following that I was a postdoctoral researcher for two years at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. 

My research interest are developmental neuroscience, interoception with a focus on the cardiovascular system, and brain-body interaction.
