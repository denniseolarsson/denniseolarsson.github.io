![Profile](/images/profile.png){: .align-right width="300px"}

I'm a cognitive neuroscience researcher and data scientist. I obtained my PhD at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom in 2022, finished a two year postdoctodal research contract at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden in 2024, and am currently looking for a job in the Netherlands. 

I enjoy coding, and have extensive experience with quantitative data analysis and programming in multiple languages, with a major focus on Python, MATLAB, and RStudio. 

My research interest are interoception with a focus on the cardiovascular system, body perception, and brain-body interaction.
